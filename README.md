## PlanIt

# Getting started for developing with docker:
 * install latest docker from official repo for debian:
   https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/debian/
 * install docker-compose globally on root user:
   `sudo pip install docker-compose`
 * clone this repo and cd to it
 * run the services:
   `sudo ./dev.sh`
   now the console output from both of them is attached to current terminal
   open in browser localhost:8000 or localhost:8000/static/css/style.css
   CTRL-C twice to stop them
